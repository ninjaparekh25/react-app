# 🚀 My Learning & Chat App Project

Welcome to my learning repository! This repo showcases my journey in mastering **React**, **TypeScript**, **MERN Stack**, **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Bootstrap**, and my ongoing **Chat App** project. Feel free to explore and contribute to my code! 😊

## 📝 Technologies Learned
Here are the technologies I've been diving into:

- **React**: A powerful library for building dynamic user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: Superset of JavaScript, offering type safety and better tooling support.
- **MERN Stack**: MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js – the most popular stack for full-stack JavaScript development.
- **Next.js**: A framework for building React applications with SSR (Server Side Rendering) and Static Site Generation (SSG).
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for building modern, responsive designs.
- **Bootstrap**: A popular front-end framework for responsive web design.

## 💬 Chat App Project
This repository also contains my **Chat App** project, where I integrate various technologies like React, Node.js, and MongoDB to build a real-time chat application. The app allows users to send and receive messages instantly with live updates.

## ⚡ Features of Chat App:
- Real-time messaging (using WebSockets/Socket.io)
- User authentication (via JWT)
- Chat rooms (private and group chats)
- Message notifications
- User profiles with customization

To clone the repository, run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

#### 2. Install Dependencies
- For **React, TypeScript, Next.js, Tailwind CSS** and **Bootstrap**, you can follow the commands below:

- **For React + TypeScript**:
  ```bash
  npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript
  cd my-app
  ```

- **For MERN Stack** (Backend):
  ```bash
  mkdir backend
  cd backend
  npm init -y
  npm install express mongoose cors socket.io jsonwebtoken bcryptjs
  ```

- **For Next.js**:
  ```bash
  npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app
  cd my-next-app
  ```

- **For Tailwind CSS**:
  Tailwind can be installed by running the following commands:
