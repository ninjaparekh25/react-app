## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installing React via Vite

Want to start a **React** app quickly? Here's how to do it with **Vite**:

1. **Check your Node.js version** to make sure you're ready to go:
   ```bash
   node -v
   ```

2. Run this command to create a new React app using Vite:
   ```bash
   npm create vite@latest my-react-app --template react
   ```

3. Navigate to your new app directory:
   ```bash
   cd my-react-app
   ```

4. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser, and you’ll be up and running! 🚀

### Setting Up a Next.js Project

To start a **Next.js** project, follow these simple steps:

1. Run this command to create a new Next.js app:
   ```bash
   npx create-next-app@latest my-nextjs-app
   ```

2. Once installed, navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd my-nextjs-app
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Launch the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

Now you can open `http://localhost:3000` and see your Next.js app in action! 🎉
